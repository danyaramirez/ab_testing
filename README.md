Introduction
In this project, we will be working to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. The goal is to help the company understand if they should implement the new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.

The file includes all sorts of analyses. The folder has all necessary files.
